# Hopkin
## Purpose
Hopkin is a template project for Apache Hop, that adds a couple of features often needed by larger projects in professional environments as :

- standardized delta value handling for extractions and transformations
- mechanism to optionally avoid jobs from being started in parallel
- mechanism to have time dependent configurations
- enhanced variable handling that allows to 
    - have job centric variables instead of global values 
    - switch variable content by startparameter
- central configuration for error mails/notifications
